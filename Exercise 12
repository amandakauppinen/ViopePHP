**Prompt**

Complete the below PHP script so that it prints the sum and average of given points. The points are sent to the script as a
character string, where points are separated with comma (e.g. 4,5,2). Points are divided into an array with the explode-function.
The purpose of the script is to print the points separated with a space. Write only the missing statements, donâ€™t write the
whole program in the text box. Incomplete program.

**Solution**

//not my code, not to by modified
<?php
    $numberstring = $_GET['numberstring'];
    $numberarray = explode(',',$numberstring);
    $points = implode(' ', $numberarray);
    
    //my code
    $average = array_sum($numberarray) / count($numberarray);
	  $sum = array_sum($numberarray);
    
 
    //not my code, not to by modified
    echo "Points were: $points\n";
    echo "Sum of points: $sum\n";
    echo "Average of points: $average";

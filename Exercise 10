<form action="salary.php" method="get">
Work hours: <input type="text" name="hours">
Hourly salary: <input type="text" name="perhour">
Tax percentage: <input type="text" name=”tax">
<input type="submit" value="Send">

<?php
	
$hours=$_GET["hours"];
$salary=$_GET["perhour"];
$tax=$_GET["tax"];

$grossSalary = $hours * $salary;
$taxDeduction = ($hours* $salary * $tax)/100;
$netSalary = $grossSalary - $taxDeduction;

if ($hours and $salary and $tax) {
	echo"Gross salary: ",$grossSalary," \n";
	echo"Tax deduction: ",$taxDeduction," \n";
	echo"Net salary: ",$netSalary," \n";

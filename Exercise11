**Prompt**

Change the elements of the array array, so that program prints the example print. You are not allowed to create a
new array, you should change the elements of the existing array. Write only the missing statements, donâ€™t write the
whole program in the text box. Incomplete program.

**Solution**

//not my code, cannot be modified
<?php
    $array = array("Kevin Rose" => "Digg Road 5",
           "Jack Dorsey" => "Twitter Street 9",
           "Mark Zuckerberg" => "Facebook Way 22");
           
//my code

/*There is no missing data from the given code to the final output, 
so I just took out an array element, and inserted it again.*/

unset($array["Mark Zuckerberg"]);
$array["Mark Zuckerberg"] = "Facebook Way 22";

//not my code, cannot be modified
    print_r($array);
?>
